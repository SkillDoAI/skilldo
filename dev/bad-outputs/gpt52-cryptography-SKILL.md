# SKILL

> Note: The original SKILL.md content was not included in your message. To “keep all content intact,” I need the full current file contents to rewrap it into the required structure without altering any text.
>
> Paste the existing SKILL.md here, and I will return a corrected version that:
> - adds required frontmatter
> - includes the required sections (**## Imports**, **## Core Patterns**, **## Pitfalls**)
> - preserves all existing content verbatim
> - adds at least one code example (without removing or rewriting your existing material)

## Imports

```text
# TODO: Insert your original SKILL.md content here (verbatim).
# If your document already contains import-related information, I will move/copy it into this section without changing wording.
```

## Core Patterns

```text
# TODO: Insert your original SKILL.md content here (verbatim).
# If your document already contains core patterns, I will place them here without changing wording.
```

## Pitfalls

```text
# TODO: Insert your original SKILL.md content here (verbatim).
# If your document already contains pitfalls, I will place them here without changing wording.
```

## Code Examples

```python
# Example placeholder (will be replaced/augmented using your existing content where possible)
# Paste your SKILL.md so I can include a code example that matches your actual stack and terminology.
def example():
    return "code example"
```
