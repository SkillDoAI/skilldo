        These are auto-generated SKILL.md files produced by an LLM pipeline.
        Do NOT leave individual review comments on each file. Instead,
        summarize all quality issues across all example skills in a single
        review comment on the PR, grouped by pattern (e.g., wrong return types,
        missing parameters, invalid syntax) rather than by file.
